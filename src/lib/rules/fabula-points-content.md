### Gaining Fabula Points

There are four main ways a Player Character can gain Fabula Pionts, plus a fifth optional method:

- If a Player Character has no Fabula Points at the start of a session, they immediately receive **1 Fabula Point**.
- Whenever a Player Character rolls a **fumble** on a Check, they immediately receive **1 Fabula Point**.
- Whenever a Villain makes an entrance during a scene &ndash; even if it is a Game Master scene, wher the Player Characters are not present &ndash; each Player Character will immediately receive **1 Fabula Point**.
- Whenever a Player Character is reduced to 0 Hit Points and decides to **Surrender**, that character immediately receives **2 Fabula Points**.
- Whenever a Player Character invokes one of their **Bonds** or **Traits** to automatically fail a Check (as per the optional rule on page **47**), that character immediately receives **1 Fabula Point**.

### Bonds
